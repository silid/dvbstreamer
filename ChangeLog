* Command completion.
* Automatic service addition/removal, new service are automatically added
  to the database and services no longer signaled in the PAT are removed. 
* All TS pid (use pid 8192 when adding a pid to a manual output to get the
  entire TS)
* Added SDT processing, can now get/update services names.
* Refactored service filter and PAT/PMT handling so now PAT and PMT processor
  only process the incoming PAT/PMT and service filter actually does the PAT
  rewrite (should allow more than 1 service filter in the future).
* Add DVB-S/C support (database has now changed slightly although shouldn't 
  affect anyone upgrading from 0.2)
* Fixed bug in cache.c when PAT version changed.
* Several patches from Tero Pelander - Thanks! (including Bug ID 1487683)

* Added some new commands
* Rewrote the TS filter callbacks todo more what they say they do. ie filter 
  now returns a bool, process now returns a packet or null, and output just 
  sends the packets.
* Fixed a couple of memory leaks where I wasn't freeing the PSI sections after
  using them.
* Continued general tidying up the project directory and getting to know 
  subversion better.
