* NEW Simpler remote interface means that it is possible to execute all commands 
   remotely, no need to use the dvbctrl command 'quote' any more.
* Reworked internal command processing means all commands can tell if the user 
   has entered a valid username/password
* Structure member rename to make sure all structures follow the camel case convention.
* New plugins:
   - Date/Time plugin  - Simple plugin to print out the UTC date and time
   - Now/Next plugin   - Plugin to display the present show EPG info and what comes next.
   - PES Extract plugin - Example plugin to show/test how to use the PESProcessor features.
                                   (You can now extract a single pid to a PES ie a DVB radio channel to an MP3 file.)
   - LCN Query plugin  - Plugin to find a service that is allocated to a logical channel number, can
                                   also display all logical channel numbers and their service names.
 * Separated out the setup component from dvbstreamer to a new app to prevent confusing users
   into always providing the channels.conf file.

---
* New scan command, to rescan a specific multiplex for changes.
* New setsfavsonly command, to enable streaming of only the audio/video/subtitle pids.
  Also rewrites the services PMT to only include these.
* Database changes
    - Descriptors now stored for PIDs in a service.
    - PCR pid moved into Services table from PIDs table.
* Bugs fixed.
    - Memory leak in cache.c
    - service deletion bug in cache.c
    - other stability fixes I've forgotten about :-)
* File output changed to use fopen64 for large file support (files greater than 2GB)


0.5
---
* Plugins! They can add commands, delivery methods, PMT/PAT processors and
  channel change callbacks.
* Ability to change the output destination after creating a service filter or
  manual output.
* New delivery methods, currently only udp://<ip address>:<port>(which was
  already there :-) ), null:// (which just throws away the packets) and 
  file://<filename>
* Several new commands, including:
  - lsservices = Replaces services command and can list all the service/
                 only the services on the current multiplex/only the services
                 on a specified multiplex.
  - lsmuxes = lists all the available multiplex.
  - lsplugins = Lists loaded plugins
  - plugininfo = Displays information on a specific plugin.
* Was using a char for getopt instead of an int, now fixed.
* Version number updated.
* Most header files are now documented.
* New list structure means there is no limit (apart from memory and CPU
  bandwidth) on the number of filters/outputs you can add.
* Service name filtering, it is now possible to remove unprintable
  characters from service names by using the -F <chararcter to use instead>
  option.
* !!!NOTE!!! Binary protocol change (slightly) to remove SSLA and SSLM and
  replaced with 1 message that takes a multiplex. Also 2 other new messages to
  get the current multiplex and another to list the available multiplexes.
* Bugs Fixed.
  - 1548113 Command line processing on PPC doesn't work
  - 1538096 Not possible to specify log file destination
  - Seg fault on exit fixed.
  - Removing service no longer in the transport stream, only some where removed
    but not all.
  - Service names getting corrupted by repeated cache writebacks.
  - Removed annoying warning from libdvbpsi about TS discontinuity after a
    multiplex change.

* Daemon mode, can now run dvbstreamer in the background and use dvbctrl to
  control/monitor it.
* Secondary service filters, allows more than 1 service to be streamed (each
  to separate IP Address:Ports).
* Signal handling (No exit in a nice clean manner, making sure the database is
  updated).
* IPv6 support added. (Thanks again Tero)
* Minor name changes to commands (mostly commands that list things now start
  with ls, mostly :-) )
* Minor change to behaviour, dvbstreamer now no longer waits for the signal to
  lock before returning from a command, useful when you have a low siganl
  strength/high noise problem!

0.3
---
* Command completion.
* Automatic service addition/removal, new service are automatically added
  to the database and services no longer signaled in the PAT are removed.
* All TS pid (use pid 8192 when adding a pid to a manual output to get the
  entire TS)
* Added SDT processing, can now get/update services names.
* Refactored service filter and PAT/PMT handling so now PAT and PMT processor
  only process the incoming PAT/PMT and service filter actually does the PAT
  rewrite (should allow more than 1 service filter in the future).
* Add DVB-S/C support (database has now changed slightly although shouldn't
  affect anyone upgrading from 0.2)
* Fixed bug in cache.c when PAT version changed.
* Several patches from Tero Pelander - Thanks! (including Bug ID 1487683)

0.2
---
* Added some new commands
* Rewrote the TS filter callbacks todo more what they say they do. ie filter
  now returns a bool, process now returns a packet or null, and output just
  sends the packets.
* Fixed a couple of memory leaks where I wasn't freeing the PSI sections after
  using them.
* Continued general tidying up the project directory and getting to know
  subversion better.
