  includes spaces.
* New scanning feature
   - Can now perform a full spectrum scan (ATSC, DVB-C/T)
   - Can now perform a network scan using information from dvb-utils (All)
* New properties API and commands allows easier access to internal properties.
  (vars are now deprecated.)
* Deprecated the Enumerator APIs for DB access and replaced with APIs that
   return a list, this is to prevent the database being locked by a running query
   that hasn't been finalised.
* Ability to release (and reacquire) the frontend to save energy.
* Fix [2377653] ATSC EPG xmltv output shows programs on wrong channel
* Added [2629610] epgtoxmltv patch to output seriesid and programid in UK EPG

* New Plugin - Traffic Monitor/Capture (thanks to Steve VanDeBogart)
* New Event framework to allow monitoring of events like signal lock, service 
   addition/removal by an external client.
* Wildcard query added for lsservices, use ls -q <query> to list all services that match <query>
   For example ls -q BBC% would list all BBC channels under freeview.

* SAP support for multicast UDP and RTP streams.
* ATSC EPG now fully working, includes event descriptions.
* Multiple dumpxmltv bugs fixed.
* 3 NEW plugins
  - QueryEPG  - Allows querying of EPG database for more details and on a finer 
                grain than dumpxmltv.
  - SICapture - This plugin is intend to aid debugging of streams that I don't 
                have access to by allowing a user to capture just the PSI and 
                DVB SI or ATSCPSIP information for attaching to a bug report etc.
  - ManualFilters - The 'manual output' feature has been removed from the core
                    and renamed to avoid confusion and make DVBStreamer more modular.
* Services can now be selected/queried by fully qualified id (network id.ts id.service id)
* New commands to simplify setting and getting the primary mrl.
* Command output has been cleaned up to make it more consistent.
* setsfavsonly command now includes the CAT table if required for a service.
* Internally
  - There is a new Deferred Procedure module and a thread safe message queue.
  - The included dvbpsi library has been updated to 0.16.
* Bugs fixed:
    1842675 'now' command, EPG info incorrectly displaying start time.
    1823706	sdtprocessor.c segfault [patch supplied]
    1819913	date command has no space/return before 'Last received'
    1841275 Correct length in UTF8 encoding
    1841279 Xmlify service name in xmltv epg

* DVB-S fully supported, thanks to Alex Luccisano.
* ATSC support, including preliminary EPG.
* DVB EPG support, now captures schedule data and can be exported to xmltv format.
* RTP support and Time To Live setting for UDP and RTP packets useful when sending
  to a multicast address.
* All text output by dvbstreamer is now in UTF-8, this includes channel names and EPG data.
* Lots of clean up in the code structure.
* Fixed major virtual memory bug.
* Turned on -Wall -Werror

0.7

* NEW Simpler remote interface means that it is possible to execute all commands 
  remotely, no need to use the dvbctrl command 'quote' any more.
* NEW plugins:
   - Date/Time plugin  - Simple plugin to print out the UTC date and time
   - Now/Next plugin   - Plugin to display the present show EPG info and what comes next.
   - PES Extract plugin- Example plugin to show/test how to use the PESProcessor features.
                         (You can now extract a single pid to a PES ie a DVB radio channel to an MP3 file.)
   - LCN Query plugin  - Plugin to find a service that is allocated to a logical channel number, can
                         also display all logical channel numbers and their service names.
* Separated out the setup component from dvbstreamer to a new app to prevent confusing users
  into always providing the channels.conf file.
* Reworked internal command processing means all commands can tell if the user 
  has entered a valid username/password
* Structure member rename to make sure all structures follow the camel case convention.
* New object based memory allocation system to help debugging and prevent memory leaks.
* Remove need for libdvbpsi, now included (heavily patched)


0.6
---
* New scan command, to rescan a specific multiplex for changes.
* New setsfavsonly command, to enable streaming of only the audio/video/subtitle pids.
  Also rewrites the services PMT to only include these.
* Database changes
    - Descriptors now stored for PIDs in a service.
    - PCR pid moved into Services table from PIDs table.
* Bugs fixed.
    - Memory leak in cache.c
    - service deletion bug in cache.c
    - other stability fixes I've forgotten about :-)
* File output changed to use fopen64 for large file support (files greater than 2GB)


0.5
---
* Plugins! They can add commands, delivery methods, PMT/PAT processors and
  channel change callbacks.
* Ability to change the output destination after creating a service filter or
  manual output.
* New delivery methods, currently only udp://<ip address>:<port>(which was
  already there :-) ), null:// (which just throws away the packets) and 
  file://<filename>
* Several new commands, including:
  - lsservices = Replaces services command and can list all the service/
                 only the services on the current multiplex/only the services
                 on a specified multiplex.
  - lsmuxes = lists all the available multiplex.
  - lsplugins = Lists loaded plugins
  - plugininfo = Displays information on a specific plugin.
* Was using a char for getopt instead of an int, now fixed.
* Version number updated.
* Most header files are now documented.
* New list structure means there is no limit (apart from memory and CPU
  bandwidth) on the number of filters/outputs you can add.
* Service name filtering, it is now possible to remove unprintable
  characters from service names by using the -F <chararcter to use instead>
  option.
* !!!NOTE!!! Binary protocol change (slightly) to remove SSLA and SSLM and
  replaced with 1 message that takes a multiplex. Also 2 other new messages to
  get the current multiplex and another to list the available multiplexes.
* Bugs Fixed.
  - 1548113 Command line processing on PPC doesn't work
  - 1538096 Not possible to specify log file destination
  - Seg fault on exit fixed.
  - Removing service no longer in the transport stream, only some where removed
    but not all.
  - Service names getting corrupted by repeated cache writebacks.
  - Removed annoying warning from libdvbpsi about TS discontinuity after a
    multiplex change.

* Daemon mode, can now run dvbstreamer in the background and use dvbctrl to
  control/monitor it.
* Secondary service filters, allows more than 1 service to be streamed (each
  to separate IP Address:Ports).
* Signal handling (No exit in a nice clean manner, making sure the database is
  updated).
* IPv6 support added. (Thanks again Tero)
* Minor name changes to commands (mostly commands that list things now start
  with ls, mostly :-) )
* Minor change to behaviour, dvbstreamer now no longer waits for the signal to
  lock before returning from a command, useful when you have a low siganl
  strength/high noise problem!

0.3
---
* Command completion.
* Automatic service addition/removal, new service are automatically added
  to the database and services no longer signaled in the PAT are removed.
* All TS pid (use pid 8192 when adding a pid to a manual output to get the
  entire TS)
* Added SDT processing, can now get/update services names.
* Refactored service filter and PAT/PMT handling so now PAT and PMT processor
  only process the incoming PAT/PMT and service filter actually does the PAT
  rewrite (should allow more than 1 service filter in the future).
* Add DVB-S/C support (database has now changed slightly although shouldn't
  affect anyone upgrading from 0.2)
* Fixed bug in cache.c when PAT version changed.
* Several patches from Tero Pelander - Thanks! (including Bug ID 1487683)

0.2
---
* Added some new commands
* Rewrote the TS filter callbacks todo more what they say they do. ie filter
  now returns a bool, process now returns a packet or null, and output just
  sends the packets.
* Fixed a couple of memory leaks where I wasn't freeing the PSI sections after
  using them.
* Continued general tidying up the project directory and getting to know
  subversion better.
