Installing DVBStreamer
======================
First you need to build DVBStreamer I would suggest building outside of the tree
as in the following example as it allows you to cleanup a build very easily.

First extract the tar file (you must have already done this part as you are 
reading this file!)

tar xjf dvbstreamer-<version>.tar.bz2

then create a directory to build it in:

mkdir dvbstreamer-build
cd dvbstreamer-build

Now run configure and then make:

<path to extracted dvbstreamer>/configure
make

Once every thing has built you can simply install it by calling make again as root:

make install
