About
-----
DVBStreamer is an console based application to stream an entire DVB service 
over UDP. 
It differs from other DVB streaming applications by the use of the DVB-SI to 
work out the PIDs to stream and correctly stream services which use a separate
PCR PID.

Requirements
------------
DVBStreamer requires the following libraries:
sqlite3 (http://www.sqlite.org/)
dvbpsi  (http://developers.videolan.org/libdvbpsi/)

Initialising DVBStreamer 
------------------------
The first time you run DVBStreamer on each adapter you will need to initialise
its database of services.
To do this use a channels.conf file generated by “scan” and use the following 
command. 
 
dvbstreamer –o <ipaddress>:<udp port> -a <adapter number> -t <channels.conf> 

You should then be presented with a prompt.  

If you have the same type (ie DVB-T) in the system you can link the database
files together so that the same information is used for all adapters.
To do this 
cd ~/.dvbstreamer 
ln adapter<initialised adapter#>.db adapter<other adapter #>.db

Starting DVBStreamer 
--------------------
Once the database has been initialsed
dvbstreamer –o <ipaddress>:<udp port> -a <adapter number> 
 
So to send a stream to 192.168.0.1 on UDP port 9999 from /dev/dvb/adapter1 use 
dvbstreamer –o 192.168.0.1:9999 –a 1 
 
You should then be presented with a prompt.  

Commands
--------

The following commands are available: 
 
select <service> - Stream the selected service. 
services – List all the available services.
multiplex – List all the available services on the current multiplex.
stats – Some not so interesting statistics on packets filtered etc.  
quit – Exit, pretty obvious really!
